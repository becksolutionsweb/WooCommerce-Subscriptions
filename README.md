# Capture More Residual Revenue with Recurring Payments

Can you guarantee how much money your store is going to make this month? If you offered subscription-based products, you could do just that.

With WooCommerce Subscriptions, you can create and manage products with recurring payments — payments that will give you residual revenue you can track and count on.

WooCommerce Subscriptions allows you to introduce a variety of subscriptions for physical or virtual products and services. Create product of the month clubs, weekly service subscriptions or even yearly software billing packages. Add sign-up fees, offer free trials or set expiration periods.

A subscription-based model will allow you to capture more residual revenue — and all you have to do is ship the orders.
